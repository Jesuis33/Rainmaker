Description: Rainfall event processing. 
=======
Description: Rainmaker is a collection of functions used to process instantaneous 
    rainfall data to define event rainfall depths, rainfall intensities, rainfall 
    erosivity and antecedent rainfall values. Event definition can be determined 
    solely within rainmaker using the instantaneous rainfall data or can be 
    focused directly on dates and times of interest (for example, using specific 
    water quality sampling periods).
